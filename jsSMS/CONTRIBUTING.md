# How to contribute?

## Coding standard

Make sure your contribution doesn't contain any ESLint errors. To check, run:

```bash
$ yarn lint
```

We recommend to enable [ESLint integration in your code editor](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations#editors).

## Coding styles

This project uses Prettier, so you don't have to worry about how to format the code.

If needed, you can force a reformat of all the code base using:

```bash
$ yarn format
```

## Testing

We don't have a test suite (but feel free to submit one!). So make sure to describe the problem
addressed by your pull request and how to test it.
